#Minion data quality control

Since 2021, the Institute for Life Sciences and Chemistry at the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences has had minION (Oxford Nanopore) sequencers to their disposal. This is a relatively new sequencing technology which utilizes a flow cell, has the advantage to generate vastly longer reads than second-gen sequencing tools (such as Illumina), at the cost of lower accuracy.
